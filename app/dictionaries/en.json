      "title": "Our Philosophy",
      "content1": "Organisms in nature have evolved over billions of years, developing astonishing diversity and adaptability. However, biological evolution has its inherent limitations. For example, organisms cannot evolve parts like wheels that can rotate continuously, which is determined by the physical and chemical properties of basic components such as biological cells, muscles, and bones.",
      "content2": "The power source of organisms is complex biochemical reactions, which are fundamentally different from mechanical power devices such as electric motors. Therefore, simply imitating the form of humans or animals to design robots does not fully leverage the advantages of mechanical and electronic technology."

But after the emergence of human civilization, doors, windows, tables, chairs, cars, houses, etc., quadrilaterals are everywhere. Because it is the most practical and efficient shape, meeting various human needs at the lowest cost. And this is our philosophy: practical, low-cost, starting from household chores, gradually penetrating into various human labor scenarios, into various industries."
